Create Database and Schemas
===============================================================
Script Purpose: This script creates a new database named 'DataWarehouse' after checking if it already exists. If the database exists, it is dropped and recreated. 
Additionally, the script sets up three schemas within the database: 'bronze', 'silver', and 'gold'.

WARNING: Running this script will drop the entire 'DataWarehouse' database if it exists. 
All data in the database will be permanently deleted. Proceed with caution and ensure you have proper backups before running this script.

/* This script ensures that the data_warehouse database is removed only if it exists.

By switching to single-user mode, it prevents multiple sessions from interfering with the deletion.

The rollback immediate ensures that no active transactions cause conflicts while dropping the database.*/
